# Loan-Prediction
Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior is a Machine Learning project aimed at identifying potential defaulters for our Consumer Loans Product. By analyzing historical customer data encompassing behaviors, transaction patterns, credit histories, and repayment trends, our model leverages advanced predictive analytics to classify new customers based on their risk of defaulting. This proactive approach allows us to customize strategies, offering a more secure lending environment while optimizing decision-making in onboarding new clients. Through this project, we strive to enhance risk assessment accuracy, streamline loan processes, and fortify our lending system's resilience.
